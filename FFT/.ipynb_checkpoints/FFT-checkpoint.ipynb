    "Later in your education, probably in a design class or for a project, you had to do realtime spectral analysis on some sort of signal (probably audio or radio). In order to do so, it is likely the case that you implemented the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform, as shown below. The relationship between our old friend the sine-cosine series and the Cooley-Tukey FFT may not be obvious. This document derives the FFT code from the sine-cosine series without skipping any steps. It does so by combining chapter 7 of [Kusse and Westwig's Mathematical Physics](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Physics-Mathematics-Scientists-Engineers/dp/3527406727) with chapter 12 of [Numerical Recipes](http://numerical.recipes).\n",

If that function is *bandwidth limited* to less than $f_c$ (i.e., has no power at freqencies greater than $f_c$), then that function is **completely determined by those samples.** Alternatively, if the continuous function *does* have power at frequencies greater in magnitude than $f_c$, then that power is mapped to frequencies in the range $-f_c<f<f_c$.
