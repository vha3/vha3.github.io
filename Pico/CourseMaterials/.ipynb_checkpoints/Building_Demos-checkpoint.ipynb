    "\n",
    "### First time\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Login to a lab PC using your netid and password\n",
    "2. Navigate to `Start menu --> Visual Studio 2019 --> Developer PowerShell for VS 2019`\n",
    "3. In the Developer powershell that opens, navigate to your own Documents directory by running:<br>\n",
    "`PS C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\BuildTools> cd C:\\Users\\NETID\\Documents`\n",
    "4. Create a new directory in your documents folder called `Pico` by running:<br>\n",
    "`PS C:\\Users\\NETID\\Documents> mkdir Pico`\n",
    "5. Navigate into the Pico directory by running:<br>\n",
    "`PS C:\\Users\\NETID\\Documents> cd Pico`\n",
    "6. Clone the RP2040 C SDK from Raspberry Pi's github by running:<br>\n",
    "`PS C:\\Users\\NETID\\Documents\\Pico> git clone -b master https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git`\n",
    "7. Navigate into the `pico-sdk` directory by running:<br>\n",
    "`PS C:\\Users\\NETID\\Documents\\Pico> cd pico-sdk`\n",
    "8. Update the SDK libraries by running:<br>\n",
    "`PS C:\\Users\\NETID\\Documents\\Pico\\pico-sdk> git submodule update --init`\n",
    "9. Navigate back to the `Pico` directory by running:<br>\n",
    "`PS C:\\Users\\NETID\\Documents\\Pico\\pico-sdk> cd ..`\n",
    "10. Clone the course demo code by running:<br>\n",
    "`PS C:\\Users\\NETID\\Documents\\Pico> git clone -b master https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos.git`\n",
    "11. Set the value of the `PICO_SDK_PATH` path variable by running:<br>\n",
    "`PS C:\\Users\\NETID\\Documents\\Pico> setx PICO_SDK_PATH \"..\\..\\pico-sdk\"`\n",
    "12. Set the value of the `PICO_TOOLCHAIN_PATH` path variable by running:<br>\n",
    "`PS C:\\Users\\NETID\\Documents\\Pico> setx PICO_TOOLCHAIN_PATH \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain\\10 2021.10\\\"`\n",
    "> - *If you are at PC 27 or 44 (check the sticker on the side of the PC), please raise your hand! This step is different for you.*\n",
    "13. **Close the Developer PowerShell for VS 2019 window.** This is required for the path variable changes to take effect.\n",
    "14. Reopen a Developer PowerShell for VS 2019 window by navigating to `Start menu --> Visual Studio 2019 --> Developer PowerShell for VS 2019`\n",
    "15. Navigate to the demos directory by running:<br>\n",
    "`PS C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\BuildTools> cd C:\\Users\\NETID\\Documents\\Pico\\Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos\\`\n",
    "16. Create a new directory in the demos folder called `build` by running:<br>\n",
    "`PS C:\\Users\\NETID\\Documents\\Pico\\Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos> mkdir build`\n",
    "17. Navigate into the new `build` directory by running:<br>\n",
    "`PS C:\\Users\\NETID\\Documents\\Pico\\Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos> cd build`\n",
    "18. Prepare the build folder by running:<br>\n",
    "`PS C:\\Users\\NETID\\Documents\\Pico\\Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos\\build> cmake -G \"NMake Makefiles\" ..`\n",
    "19. Build all demos by running:<br>\n",
    "`PS C:\\Users\\NETID\\Documents\\Pico\\Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos\\build> nmake`\n",
    "20. In a Folder Explorer window, navigate into `Documents/Pico/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos/build`. There, you will find a folder for each project in the demo repository. Each folder contains the executables for that particular project. To program the RP2040 with one of those executables, press the `BOOTSEL` button, plug it into the PC, and drag/drop the uf2 file for that project onto the external memory device that appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Every subsequent time\n",
    "1. Navigate to `Start menu --> Visual Studio 2019 --> Developer PowerShell for VS 2019`\n",
    "2. In the Developer powershell that opens, navigate to the build directory in the demonstrations foler by running:<br>\n",
    "`PS C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\BuildTools> cd C:\\Users\\NETID\\Documents\\Pico\\Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos\\build\\`\n",
    "3. Build all demos by running:<br>\n",
    "`PS C:\\Users\\NETID\\Documents\\Pico\\Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos\\build> nmake`\n",
