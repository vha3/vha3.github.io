    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this course is to enable students to carry out sophisticated designs of the modern digital systems which now appear in products such as automobiles, appliances, and industrial tools. The basis of such systems is the microcontroller, a microcomputer optimized for single-chip system design by possessing many peripheral devices geared to real-time applications. The microcontroller we will use is the RP2040 from Raspberry Pi. There is a large design project which is due the last week of classes. There will considerable emphasis on hardware concurrency: Getting good performance by using all of the concurrently executing co-processors available on the microcontroller chip, including: DMA, timers, SPI, UART, ADC subsystem, PIO, I2C and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "***This is a design course.*** This means that we will expect you to show considerable creativity, flexibility, and motivation. In particular, you will need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hit the web to find your own answers to questions you have.\n",
    "- Read and understand every aspect of manufacturer's data sheets for a variety of devices.\n",
    "- Read class-related email daily. You are responsible for any course information communicated by email.\n",
    "- Use material from many of the courses you have taken at Cornell. Topics from ECE 2100, 3010, 3020, 3100, 3140, 4450, or 4750 may be useful in this course, particularly depending on the final project you choose.\n",
    "- ***Find solutions on your own from incomplete specifications.*** The lab assignments become more open-ended as the semester progresses. Clever, efficient solutions will be rewarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are trying to make this a little like the real world."

    "## Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The policy\n",
    "\n",
    "This class is composed of laboratory assignments and a final project. You will be graded on these tasks, plus some consideration of class participation. The final design project demonstration is due the *last week of classes*. The grade breakdown is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **50% for laboratory assignments**\n",
    "> For *each* laboratory assignment:<br><br>\n",
    "> - 10% for preparedness and participation\n",
    "> > - As determined by conversations with Hunter in the laboratory, lecture attendance, and occasional in-lecture quizzes.\n",
    "> > - These should be easy points, just come to class!\n",
    "> - 20% for weekly progress deadlines (evenly distributed across all weeks for a particular lab)\n",
    "> > - To make these deadlines, you *must come to lab prepared*. If you do not do any out-of-class preparations, you will not be able to meet these deadlines.\n",
    "> > - Finishing a checkpoint on time will earn the student a 95% (A-equivalent). Finishing early will earn the student >95% (exceeds expectations). Missing milestones earns a 0.\n",
    "> > - If you checkoff on the required progress deadline before the end of lab, you are expected to stay and work on the next checkpoint.\n",
    "> > - **A late progress checkoff receives a zero grade.**\n",
    "> - 30% for the final laboratory demonstration\n",
    "> > - The system must meet specifications and be usable.\n",
    "> > - Lab demos to TAs will be done before the **end** of each lab exercise, in lab.\n",
    "> > - There will be ***no late final demonstrations for any lab***. This policy is to prevent any students from falling behind on subsequent lab exercises.\n",
    "> > - Your final demo may or may not include a code review to test for understanding.\n",
    "> > - **A late demo receives a zero grade.** If you run out of time, demonstrate the parts of the system that you've gotten working. These final demos are graded on the following scale:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Technical specifications met | Score | Comments |\n",
    "| :--- | ---: | ---: |\n",
    "| < Week 1 checkoff | 0 |  |\n",
    "| = Week 1 checkoff | 50% | |\n",
    "| <= Week 2 checkoff | 50-75% | Directly proportional to number of<br> specifications met, weighted by <br>relative difficulty of those specifications\n",
    "| <= Week 3 checkoff | 75-96% | Directly proportional to number of<br> specifications met, weighted by <br>relative difficulty of those specifications\n",
    "| > Week 3 checkoff | 96-100% | Students that exceed expectations<br> on a laboratory assignment will<br> receive A+ equivalent scores\n",
    "\n",
    "- \n",
    "> - 40% for the laboratory report\n",
    "> > - Lab reports are due *before the start* of your next lab period.\n",
    "> > - Please see the [Laboratory reports](#Laboratory-reports) section of this webpage for information on content.\n",
    "> > - All submissions will be electronic to your TA, via Canvas\n",
    "> > - You must attend your weekly scheduled lab period, even if you have finished the lab assignment early!\n",
    "> > - No late assignments will be accepted without prior permission (excepting reasonable extenuating circumstances)\n",
    "> > - You will turn in one lab report per team. No written collaborations between groups is permitted. You are (of course!) encouraged to help anyone in lab.\n",
    "> > - For some information about how these reports are graded, please see [here](./LabReportGrade.html).\n",
    "> > - **A late report receives a zero grade**.\n",
    "- **50% for the final project**\n",
    "> This is further broken down similarly to the laboratory assignments:<br><br>\n",
    "> - 10% for preparedness and participation\n",
    "> > - As determined by conversations with Hunter in the laboratory, lecture attendance, and occasional in-lecture quizzes.\n",
    "> > - These should be easy points, just come to class!\n",
    "> - 20% for weekly progress deadlines (evenly distributed across all weeks of the final project)\n",
    "> > - For the final project **you** are responsible for establishing these weekly milestones.\n",
    "> > - Meeting milestones on time will earn the student a 95% (A-equivalent). Finishing early will earn the student >95% (exceeds expectations). Missing milestones earns a 0.\n",
    "> > - You will report your progress to me in a weekly update (which may be either written or verbal)\n",
    "> > - **A late progress checkoff receives a zero grade.**\n",
    "> > - **NOTE**: I know that plans change, and that sometimes things are harder than you think they might be!! As long as you are communicating with me and working at a reasonable rate, your grade will not be adversely affected by changes of plan.\n",
    "> - 30% for the final laboratory demonstration\n",
    "> > - The system must meet the specifications that you set at the beginning of the project (i.e., did you build what you said you were going to build?)\n",
    "> > - The system must be usable.\n",
    "> > - Your final demo may or may not include a code review to test for understanding.\n",
    "> > - For the final project, your demo will also be evaluated on its sophistication *relative to other final projects*. This is to prevent gaming the system by choosing an easy project.\n",
    "> - 40% for the final report\n",
    "> > - Please see [this webpage](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/CourseMaterials/Final_Project.html#Final-Report) for information on content.\n",
    "> > - For some information about how these reports are graded, please see [here](./LabReportGrade.html).\n",
    "> > - You will create a webpage for your final project.\n",

    "Hunter reserves the right to make small adjustments to your grade. You may help your grade by participating in class discussions. Excessive nonattendance of lecture may lower your grade. If you feel that you have been unfairly graded, you have one week from the time the assignment is handed back to request a regrade. To request a regrade, you must submit the assignment with a written description of your concern attached to the instructor (not the TA).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reflecting on this policy\n",
    "Building things is difficult, and sometimes unpredictable. It may be the case that you don't make a weekly checkpoint. This can sometimes cause students to panic, and sometimes doing the math to determine how much of your final grade each component of the course is worth can alleviate that panic. The contribution to your final grade (as a percentage) of each assignment and checkout is listed below.\n",
