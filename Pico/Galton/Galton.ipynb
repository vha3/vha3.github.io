    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this laboratory exercise, you will engineer a digital version of a Galton Board, which is one of the most famous physical demonstrations of order from chaos that has ever been constructed. The Galton Board delightfully combines *five* famous mathematical concepts: Bernoilli trials, the binomial distribution, the Gaussian distribution, Pascal's triangle, and the central limit theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Galton Board is composed of interleaved rows of pegs. When one drops a ball onto the top row of pegs, it bounces its way to the bottom and ultimately lands in one of N+1 bins that rest between and beneath the N lowest pegs in the board. In an idealized Galton Board, the ball bounces against a peg in each row of the board. When it strikes that peg, it has a 50% chance of bouncing to the left, and a 50% chance of bouncing to the right. If you repeat this experiment over and over and over again, the count of balls in the bins forms a nice clean binomial distribution. And as the number of rows increases and the number of trials increases, this binomial distribution, by the central limit theorem, approaches a Gaussian distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is really startling to watch! In fact, this phenomenon so impressed Francis Galton that he stated:\n",
    "\n",
    "*The law [the central limit theorem] would have been personified by the Greeks and deified, if they had known of it. It reigns with serenity and in complete self-effacement amidst the wildest confusion. The huger the mob, and the greater the apparent anarchy, the more perfect is its sway. It is the supreme law of Unreason. Whenever a large sample of chaotic elements are taken in hand and marshalled in the order of their magnitude, an unsuspected and most beautiful form of regularity proves to have been latent all along.*\n",
    "\n",
    "You will build a digital version of a board, through which you will drop as many balls as you can manage at 30 frames per second. The more thoughtful and efficient your code, the more balls you will be able to animate. Every time any ball strikes a peg there must be a \"thunk!\" sound effect. You don't want to waste cycles doing interrupt-based audio synthesis, so you will use a DMA channel to trigger the sound effects. The balls will bounce according to collision physics. You must count and plot the number of balls that land in each bin at the bottom of the board so that we can see the central limit theorem in action. You will implement a potentiometer-based interface that allows for the user to adjust parameters in realtime and thereby \"play\" with the central limit theorem.\n",
