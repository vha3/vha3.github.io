    "In this lab, you will construct and control of a one-degree-of-freedom helicopter. A small ducted is rigidly attached to the end of a lever-arm, the other end of which is attached to a hinge. The drone motor can lift the arm, and the angle of the arm is estimated via a complementary filter of accelerometer and gyro measurements from an onboard IMU. The user can select a target arm-angle and a PID controller will drive the arm to that angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target and measured angle are displayed on the oscilloscope *or* the VGA screen and the user specifies new target angles through a serial interface to the RP2040. <br><br>\n",
