    "## The Pico W WiFi stack\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two libraries that facilitate WiFi on the Pi Pico W. There exists a very low-level library, `cyw43_driver`, that allows for interaction with the CYW43 chip via an SPI interface. For almost everyone, this library is probably a layer or two *beneath* that on which they will be doing most of their engineering. The pico SDK includes a slightly-higher-level library, `pico_cyw43_arch`, which implements some functions that use the low-level driver to do things like scan for access points, connect to access points, etc. This is the lowest-level library that most folks will probably use in their projects, and they'll use this library to *setup* WiFi rather than sending data over WiFi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above this sits the `pico_lwip` library, which is a wrapper for Adam Dunkels' [Lightweight IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LwIP). This is a open-sourced TCP/IP stack designed for embedded systems, and ported to the Pi Pico W.\n",
    "\n",
    "This webpage focuses only on how one uses the `pico_cyw43_arch` library to setup a WiFi connection with a Pico W. Subsequent webpages will discuss how to utilize the `pico_lwip` library to exchange data over WiFi via UDP and TCIP/IP. As a resource for this documentation, I am making extensive use of [Master the Raspberry Pi Pico in C: WiFi with LWIP and mbedutils](https://www.amazon.com/Master-Raspberry-Pi-Pico-mbedtls/dp/1871962811/ref=pd_bxgy_thbs_d_sccl_1/145-0480932-9991861?pd_rd_w=K3PxJ&content-id=amzn1.sym.dcf559c6-d374-405e-a13e-133e852d81e1&pf_rd_p=dcf559c6-d374-405e-a13e-133e852d81e1&pf_rd_r=KG4YEA5VKCP6WVB02XPG&pd_rd_wg=D8Le5&pd_rd_r=270e4e0e-0a3d-40c0-a916-99aec74f4d9d&pd_rd_i=1871962811&psc=1). I'm also making use of the [LWIP examples](https://github.com/lwip-tcpip/lwip/tree/master/contrib/apps), and the [pi pico examples](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/master/pico_w/wifi/udp_beacon). Bruce also has some [really nice examples](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/RP2040/C_SDK_LWIP/UDP_2_pico/index_udp_2_pico.html) from which to start a project."

    "## What happens when we connect to WiFi?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before describing this process for the pico in particular, it is helpful to understand the process in general. When we connect a device to a WiFi network, the following occurs:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting up a network\n",
    "1. Our router connects to the Internet via its modem, and receives a public IP address from the Internet Service Provider (ISP).\n",
    "1. During setup/configuration, the router will prompt for (or automatically assign) a *country code.* This tells the router which channels and power levels are legally allowed in that particular region.\n",
    "1. The router may also ask the user to choose a security protocol. One often chooses WPA2-Mixed, which supports both WPA2-AES for newer devices and WPA-TKIP for older ones.\n",
    "2. The router sets up the *local* network, and assigns itself a private IP address on that network. These local IP addresses are usually of the form 192.168.1.X, and it's often the case that the router will take 192.168.1.1. \n",
    "3. This router will also prepare a *subnet mask* (e.g. 255.255.255.0). The subnet mask tells all devices on the local network which part of the IP address represents the *network*, and which part represents the *specific device on that network.* For example, a device with IP address 192.168.1.20 on a network with subnet mask 255.255.255.0 uses the first three parts of the IP (192.168.1) to identify the network, and the last part of the IP (20) to identify the device on that network.\n",
    "4. The router also generally makes itself the *gateway* for the network. Any device that wants to send a message to another device with an IP that indicates (by way of the subnet mask) that it is *not* on the subnet, will instead forward the message to the gateway, which subsequently sends out out to the Internet. The gateway is the door from the local network to the broader Internet. If the IP indicates that the device *is* on the local network, then we don't bother the gateway.\n",
    "5. The router starts up a DHCP server (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). This will automatically assign local IP addresses to new devices which join the network. It has a collection from which it can choose, of a size dictated by the subnet mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connecting to the network\n",
    "1. We connect to the network by way of that network's SSID (i.e., it's name). This SSID is broadcast by the router as part of the WiFi signal so that devices can see it. Connection often requires a password.\n",
    "2. When we connect, the router will use its DHCP server to assign us a local IP address, and it will send us the local network gateway and subnet mask. That's all the info that we need to join that network.\n",
    "3. It's often the case that this connection is wireless! Bruce has documented the wireless link considerations for the Pico W at [this webpage](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/RP2040/C_SDK_setup/WIFI/index_wifi_setup.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "After connection, of course, there's a whole other protocol by which information is actually exchanged. But let's save that conversation, and focus only on getting a Pico W connected to a network."

    "#### Initializing the hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "Before connecting to a WiFi network, we must initialize the CYW43 chip itself. As a part of this initialization, we must tell the chip which country its in, so that it knows which channels and power levels it should use. In order to do this, we have two options. We could either call the `pico_cyw43_arch` library function `int cyw43_arch_init_with_country(uint32_t country)` which, as an argument, takes the country code. Macros for these country codes are available at [pico-sdk/lib/cyw43-driver/src/cyw43_country.h](https://github.com/georgerobotics/cyw43-driver/blob/c1075d4bc440422cf2b2fd12c64a1f53f77660ee/src/cyw43_country.h). Alternatively, we can simply call `int cyw43_arch_init(void)`, which uses the country code set by `PICO_CYW43_ARCH_DEFAULT_COUNTRY_CODE` in `cyw43_arch.h`. By default, this is set to \"worldwide.\" Everything that happens when we call this function is described to excruciating depth on [this webpage](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/BLE/BTStack_HCI.html#Initializing-the-CYW43-Driver)."

We will consider each, but let us start with *station mode*, in which the Pico W will connect to a network.

    "\n",
    "After having made the connection to a network, we are out of the lower-level `pico_cyw43_arch` library and up into the `pico_lwip` library. This library contains a number of different modules, but the module of relevance for viewing and customizing our network interface is NETIF. It is via this module that we can learn all the network information that the access point gave us upon connection: our IP, netmask, gateway, etc. In particular, all this information gets stored in a struct called `netif_default`. This struct has three fields: `ip_attr_t ip_addr`, `ip_addr_t netmask`, and `ip_addr_t gw` which represent our assigned IP, netmask, and gateway.\n",
    "\n",
